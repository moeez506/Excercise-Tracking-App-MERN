# Exercise Tracker MERN


## Description

Track your workouts with Fitness Tracker. The app will keep track of every exercise in your workout. The app dashboard will display weekly summary graphs of all workouts done in a week. The fitness tracker allows the user to create a workout where they enter various exercises associated to the workout.  The data can then be analyzed with an included stats page that provides insights into the details of all their workouts.  In this homework assignment, the challenge is to connect the included frontend with a backend that is to be built using *React MongoDB, Mongoose and Express*.
